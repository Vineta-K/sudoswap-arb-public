# sudoswap-arb-public
- My first real project in rust - created to learn lower level language.
- Searcher to arbitrage NFTs intra Sudo & NFTx pools, struture loosely based off other public repos by gakonst & Alcibiades-Capital.
- No longer viably profitable due to high mainnet bribes, more efficient competition and few opportunities compared to searchers including Opensea style marketplaces in search.
- Released for information only, potential for critical bugs, if you use in production you may lose everything (I wrote a lot of this late at night and am not a software engineer by trade).
